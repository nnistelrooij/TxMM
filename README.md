With the help of YouTube comments, I was able to infer the sentiment of YouTube videos with a Bayesian process.

I then subsequently learned a topic model with Latent Dirichlet Analysis and inferred the sentiment of the topics using the sentiment of the videos.

Running `sentiment/videos_sentiment.py` and `topics/topic_sentiment.py` will plot most of the figures and tables in the paper. You do need the data for that, though which takes three days to collect with the YouTube Data API.

You can also ask me for the data and I can provide the cleaned data via download.
